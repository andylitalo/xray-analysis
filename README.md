# xray-analysis

Contains code for performing analysis of X-ray scattering data.

## tube_blowing

Contains code for analyzing *in situ* videos and scattering data of the
expansion of PLLA plastic tubes, a key step in the production of PLLA-based
bioresorbable vascular scaffolds (alternative to metal stents for blood clots).
Original development by Dr. Karthik Ramachandran. Expanded functionality and
accessibility and improved robustness by Andy Ylitalo.

## nanoparticles

Python code to extract X-ray scattering signal from nanoparticles in solution.

## radio-opacity

Brief exploration of the capabilities of determining the radio-opacity of
PLLA tubes with different content of tungsten-disulfide nanotubes (WS2NT).
